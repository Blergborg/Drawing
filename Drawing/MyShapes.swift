    /**
     NOTE:
     If you look at the preview of our arc, chances are it looks nothing like you expect. We asked for an arc from 0 degrees to 110 degrees with a clockwise rotation, but we appear to have been given an arc from 90 degrees to 200 degrees with a counterclockwise rotation.

     Whatâ€™s happening here is two-fold:

         In the eyes of SwiftUI 0 degrees is not straight upwards, but instead directly to the right.
         Shapes measure their coordinates from the bottom-left corner rather than the top-left corner, which means SwiftUI goes the other way around from one angle to the other. This is, in my not very humble opinion, extremely alien.

     We can fix both of those problems with a new path(in:) method that subtracts 90 degrees from the start and end angles, and also flips the direction so SwiftUI behaves the way nature intended:
     */
    
    func path(in rect: CGRect) -> Path {
        let rotationAdjustment = Angle.degrees(90)
        let modifiedStart = startAngle - rotationAdjustment
        let modifiedEnd = endAngle - rotationAdjustment

        var path = Path()
        path.addArc(center: CGPoint(x: rect.midX, y: rect.midY), radius: rect.width / 2, startAngle: modifiedStart, endAngle: modifiedEnd, clockwise: !clockwise)

        return path
    }
}
